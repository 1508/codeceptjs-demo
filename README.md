# CodeceptJS

Demo of how CodeceptJS can be used to test various urls and what response codes the server gives back

Can be used to test core pages after a commit, and see if they respond as they should.

## How to start

Checkout the repo, then do `npm install` and once that is done, you can fire up the demo by running `npm test`.

This will fire up a local express webserver and run some very basic tests against it.
